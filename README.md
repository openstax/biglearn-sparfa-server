## Purpose

Python tasks used to support Biglearn and conduct calculations.

## Get Started

### Installing the system dependencies on OS X

This section describes how to install the dependencies on Mac OS X.

The instructions assume you have previously installed [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

Install the following packages:

```
brew install \
    postgresql
    python3
```

> NOTE: Unfortunately you need to install the postgresql package, because Homebrew does not currently provide a standalone libpq package.

### Cloning the repos

- Clone biglearn-sparfa-server and biglearn-sparfa-algs to dirs under the same parent dir.

### Installing the services

The following external services are required:

- PostgreSQL 9.6+
- RabbitMQ 3.6+

How you install these services is up to you, but the easiest way is by using
Docker and Docker Compose. This should work on any OS that docker can be installed on.

1.  Install Docker and Docker Compose by following the instructions on the
    [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2.  Run Docker Compose:

    `docker-compose up`

    You will now have two containers running PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ.
    `docker ps` will show the running containers.
    You can connect to the PostgreSQL database by running
    `psql postgresql://postgres@localhost:5445/postgres`.

    When you want to shut the containers down you can interrupt the `docker-compose` command.
    If you would rather run them in the background, you can run `docker-compose up -d`.

3. If not running the container in daemon mode, open a new terminal window.

### Installing biglearn-sparfa-server

1. Install python 3 if you don't have it already.

2. Create a virtualenv and install dependencies:

    `make venv`

    > NOTE: This command assumes biglearn-sparfa-server and biglearn-sparfa-algs
            are cloned in dirs under the same parent dir.

3. Activate the virtualenv

    `. .venv/bin/activate`

4. Set environmental variables. See `.env.example` for required variables to be set.

5. Initialize the database:

    `make initdb`

## SPARFa Server

The SPARFa server runs the celery worker and the beat process to start all periodic tasks.
The tasks are the loader tasks and the calculations.
Make sure you have the database and RabbitMQ services running.

    `sparf server`

## Migration Folder and Files

The migrations are stored in the directory `migrations/versions`.
Each migration file begins with a hash and includes part of the
revision message that was posted at the command line.

`b9287092c49f_initial_schema.py`

## Running Alembic Commands

### Autogenerating migrations

The `models.py` file contains all the models that represent
the tables in the biglearn-sparfa-server database.
The models can be changed and migration files can be autogenerated.
However, not everything can be autodetected.
Visit the [alembic](http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/autogenerate.html#what-does-autogenerate-detect-and-what-does-it-not-detect) documentation to see what can be autogenerated.

If a change has been made to the `models.py` file run the following to create a migration file.

`alembic revision --autogenerate -m "added X column to X table"`

Review the generated file in order to make any necessary changes.

### Manual migrations

If a migration file needs to be created manually run:

`alembic revision -m "added X table to the database"`

Edit the migration file that was created with the proper migration code.

### Run all migrations

`alembic upgrade head`

### Moving back and forth between migrations

It is often very helpful to run a migration one version at a time for testing.

In order to downgrade a migration you can use the `downgrade` option.

`alembic downgrade -1`

This will downgrade the database 1 version from the current version.

In a similar fashion you can upgrade a migration a specific number of versions by using the `upgrade` option.

`alembic upgrade +1`

This will upgrade the database 1 version from the current version.

### Viewing the history

In order to view the revisions in order the `history` command can be used.

`alembic history`

This will output:

```
b9287092c49f -> cbac16278e4f (head), added biglearn knowledge models
<base> -> b9287092c49f, initial schema
```

This shows the base started at `b9287092c49f` which is a version named "initial schema" which is followed by `cbac16278e4f` which is a version labeled "added biglearn knowledge models".
