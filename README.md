## Purpose

Python tasks used to support Biglearn and conduct calculations.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

1.  Install the required dependencies:

    - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev`
    - OS X: Get [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't already have it
            and then run `brew install postgresql`

    > NOTE: Unfortunately you need to install the postgresql package,
            because Homebrew does not currently provide a standalone libpq package.

2.  Make sure you have a way to install a specific version of python.
    Biglearn-sparfa-server requires python >= 3.5 and < 3.7.
    We recommend [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
    Make sure to follow all the installation instructions,
    including adding the required lines to your profile and restarting the shell.

3.  Install python 3.6.6:

    `pyenv install 3.6.6`

4.  Clone the biglearn-sparfa-server and biglearn-sparfa-algs repos.

5.  `cd` into biglearn-sparfa-server.

6.  Make sure pip is using the correct version of python:

    `pip --version`

    If pip does not say it is using python 3.6,
    something is probably wrong with your pyenv installation.

### External Services

The following external services are required:

- PostgreSQL 9.6
- Redis 4.0
- RabbitMQ 3.6

We recommend you install them using Docker and Docker Compose.
This should work on any OS that docker can be installed on:

1.  Install Docker and Docker Compose by following the instructions on the
    [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2.  Run Docker Compose:

    `docker-compose up`

    You will now have three containers running PostgreSQL, Redis and RabbitMQ.
    `docker ps` will show the running containers.
    You can connect to the PostgreSQL database by running
    `psql postgresql://postgres@localhost:5445/postgres`.

    When you want to shut the containers down you can interrupt the `docker-compose` command.
    If you would rather run them in the background, you can run `docker-compose up -d`.

3.  If not running Docker Compose in daemon mode, open a new terminal window.

### Installation

1.  `cd` into biglearn-sparfa-server.

2.  Install biglearn-sparfa-algs:

    `pip install -e path/to/biglearn-sparfa-algs`

3.  Install biglearn-sparfa-server:

    `pip install -e .[dev]`

4.  Copy .env.example into .env and add the API tokens for biglearn-api and biglearn-scheduler.
    Also make sure the URLs are correct for the environment you desire to use.

5.  Initialize the database user and database and run all migrations:

    `make setup-all`

## SPARFA CLI

- `sparfa load` and `sparfa calc` can run individual loaders and calculations.
  Run these commands to obtain a list of available loaders and calculations.

- `sparfa server` starts the celery worker and beat process.
  This will run all periodic tasks, including loaders and calculations.
  Make sure you have the external services running before you run this command.

- `sparfa celery` can be used to send commands directly to the Celery CLI.

## Migrations

Alembic is used to manage migrations in biglearn-sparfa-server.

### Running migrations

- `alembic upgrade head` will run all migrations.

- `alembic downgrade -1` will rollback the last migration.

- `alembic upgrade +1` will apply the next migration.

- `alembic history` will show the migration version history.

### Creating migrations

Migrations are stored in the `migrations/versions` directory.
Each migration file begins with a hash and includes the
revision message that was posted at the command line.

The `sparfa_server/models.py` file contains all the models that represent
the tables in the biglearn-sparfa-server database.
The models can be changed and migration files can be autogenerated.
However, not everything can be autodetected.
Visit the
[alembic](http://alembic.zzzcomputing.com/en/latest/autogenerate.html#what-does-autogenerate-detect-and-what-does-it-not-detect)
documentation to see what can be autogenerated.

If a change has been made to the `models.py` file, run the following to create a migration file:

`alembic revision --autogenerate -m "added X column to X table"`

If a migration file needs to be created manually, instead run:

`alembic revision -m "added X table to the database"`

In either case, review the generated file in order to
add the proper migration code or make any necessary changes.
